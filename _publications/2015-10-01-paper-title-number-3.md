This work aims to characterise renal tumour microstructure using diffusion MRI (dMRI); via the Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours (VERDICT)-MRI framework with self-supervised learning. Comprehensive datasets were acquired from 14 patients with 15 biopsy-confirmed renal tumours, with nine b-values in the range b=[0,2500]s/mm2. A three-compartment VERDICT model for renal tumours was fitted to the dMRI data using a self-supervised deep neural network, and ROIs were drawn by an experienced uroradiologist. An economical acquisition protocol for future studies with larger patient cohorts was optimised using a recursive feature selection approach. The VERDICT model described the diffusion data in renal tumours more accurately than IVIM or ADC. Combined with self-supervised deep learning, VERDICT identified significant differences in the intracellular volume fraction between cancerous and normal tissue, and in the vascular volume fraction between vascular and non-vascular. The deep-learning-based feature selector yields a 4 b-value acquisition of b = [70,150,1000,2000], with a duration of 14 minutes.
