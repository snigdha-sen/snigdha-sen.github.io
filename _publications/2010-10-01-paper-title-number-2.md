excerpt: 'Mp-MRI has moderate specificity for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, resulting in many false positive results and unnecessary biopsies for patients with other prostatic diseases. This work presents an approach using VERDICT-MRI to investigate differences in microstructural parameter estimates between normal prostate tissue, false positive lesions and clinically-significant cancer.'

Mp-MRI has moderate specificity for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, resulting in many false positive results and unnecessary biopsies for patients with other prostatic diseases. This work presents an approach using VERDICT-MRI to investigate differences in microstructural parameter estimates between normal prostate tissue, false positive lesions and clinically-significant cancer.
