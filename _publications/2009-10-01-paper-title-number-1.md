excerpt: 'False positives on multiparametric MRIs (mp-MRIs) result in many unnecessary invasive biopsies in men with clinically insignificant diseases. This study investigated whether quantitative diffusion MRI could differentiate between false positives, true positives and normal tissue non-invasively.'
