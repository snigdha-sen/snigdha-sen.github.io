I'm a PhD student in the Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science at UCL, supervised by Dr. Eleftheria Panagiotaki. 

My research focuses on developing deep learning techniques to improve prostate cancer diagnosis via diffusion MRI. My specific areas of interest include self-supervised learning, computational modelling and model selection/fitting.

Previously, I received my MPhys in Physics with Theoretical Physics from Imperial College London and my MRes in Medical Imaging from UCL.
