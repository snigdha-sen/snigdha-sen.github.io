I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Computer Science at UCL.

My research focuses on developing deep learning techniques to improve prostate and renal cancer diagnosis via diffusion MRI. My specific areas of interest include multi-modal integration of diffusion MRI, self-supervised learning and generative models.

Previously, I was a Research Scientist Intern at Virdx (QuantCo). I received my PhD and MRes in Medical Imaging from UCL, and my MPhys in Physics with Theoretical Physics from Imperial College London.
